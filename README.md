# Wiktionary to Mongo

Fetches latest enwiktionary dump into friendly mongo bson export

Need that for [Wiktionary Parser](https://github.com/darvin/wiktionary-parser) - project for parsing/analysing connections between words.


## Note to Github && Travis employees

Thank you for your support of open source projects! While I'm using Github for hosting of 2GB Wiktionary dump and Travis for running 2h long build job, I promise to do that no more than once per month or so (and clean old builds)
